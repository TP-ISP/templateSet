## design

As you can see, the "heywego" is based on HTML5 geolocation API,  thus,  if you want to visit the web app, an modern navigator is necessary.

We set our layout in a simple style with just  black and white, look comfortable?

The new CSS or HTML api in our project:

* flexbox
* transition
* canvas-2d
* table-cell
* coloum text
* prepserve-3D

Go ahead to do!
